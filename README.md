# Description

The goal of this project was to practice using ready-made components from Ant Design. Several pages were created, including a ToDo list with the ability to create task descriptions and due dates, an image gallery, an about us page with pagination, a team page, and a page showcasing other projects. This project allowed for hands-on experience with Ant Design components and the implementation of various functionalities within a React application.
